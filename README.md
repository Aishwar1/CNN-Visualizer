# 🧠 CNN Feature Visualization Tool

A deep learning visualization system that analyzes and visualizes how **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** extract features across layers.  
This project focuses on understanding **what CNNs learn internally** by visualizing feature maps, weights, and layer-wise behavior across popular architectures.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This tool explores how CNN architectures progressively learn **edges, textures, shapes, and spatial hierarchies** from images.  
Instead of treating CNNs as black boxes, the project exposes internal representations to improve interpretability and debugging of deep learning models.

## 🧩 Supported Models
- VGG16  
- VGG19  
- ResNet  
- Inception
